    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "- The CPU does not work in isolation; it needs to communicate with **memory**, **input/output (I/O) devices**, and **peripherals**.\n",
    "- This communication is essential for data exchange, instruction execution, and interaction with external components.\n",

    "### üõ£Ô∏è System Buses\n",
    "CPU communicates with external components via **buses**:\n",
    "- **Data Bus**: Transfers data between CPU, memory, and I/O devices.\n",
    "- **Address Bus**: Carries the address of memory or I/O locations to access.\n",
    "- **Control Bus**: Carries control signals (e.g., Read/Write, Clock, Interrupts).\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. **Memory Communication**\n",
    "- **Read/Write operations** to RAM or ROM.\n",
    "- Uses MAR (Memory Address Register) and MDR (Memory Data Register).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **I/O Communication**\n",
    "- Interaction with external devices like keyboard, mouse, display, etc.\n",
    "- Managed using **I/O ports** or **memory-mapped I/O**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Interrupt Handling**\n",
    "- External devices can send **interrupt signals** to request CPU attention.\n",
    "- CPU stops current execution, saves state, and executes **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Methods of Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÅ Programmed I/O\n",
    "- CPU actively waits and polls devices.\n",
    "- Simple but inefficient (wastes CPU cycles).\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÅ Interrupt-Driven I/O\n",
    "- Devices notify CPU when ready via interrupt.\n",
    "- Efficient, as CPU can perform other tasks until needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÅ Direct Memory Access (DMA)\n",
    "- Allows devices to directly transfer data to/from memory without CPU intervention.\n",
    "- CPU only sets up the transfer, freeing it for other tasks.\n",

    "| Interface       | Description |\n",
    "|------------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **PCI/PCIe**     | High-speed interface for attaching peripherals. |\n",
    "| **USB**          | Universal interface for a wide range of devices. |\n",
    "| **Serial/Parallel Ports** | Older forms of communication interfaces. |\n",
    "| **Ethernet**     | Network communication for data transfer between systems. |\n",

    "\n",
    "## 6. Synchronization and Handshaking\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensures both CPU and device are ready to communicate.\n",
    "- **Handshaking signals** coordinate timing and status (e.g., Ready, Acknowledge).\n",

    "## 7. Summary\n",
    "- CPU communicates with memory and peripherals via buses and interfaces.\n",
    "- Efficient communication methods like **DMA** and **interrupts** enhance performance.\n",
