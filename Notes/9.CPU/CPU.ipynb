    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** is the brain of the computer.\n",
    "- It performs all arithmetic and logical operations and controls all components.\n",
    "- Also called **Processor** or **Microprocessor** in microcomputers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Major Components of CPU\n",
    "\n",
    "| Component        | Description |\n",
    "|------------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **ALU** (Arithmetic Logic Unit) | Performs arithmetic (add, subtract) and logic operations (AND, OR, NOT). |\n",
    "| **CU** (Control Unit)           | Directs operations of the processor. It tells memory, ALU, and I/O devices how to respond to instructions. |\n",
    "| **Registers**                  | Small, fast memory units inside the CPU. Used to store intermediate data, instructions, addresses. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Types of Registers\n",
    "- **MAR (Memory Address Register)** â€“ Holds address of memory location.\n",
    "- **MDR (Memory Data Register)** â€“ Holds data being transferred to/from memory.\n",
    "- **IR (Instruction Register)** â€“ Holds the current instruction.\n",
    "- **PC (Program Counter)** â€“ Holds address of next instruction.\n",
    "- **ACC (Accumulator)** â€“ Stores intermediate results from ALU.\n",
    "- **General Purpose Registers (R0â€“Rn)** â€“ Used for general computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. CPU Buses\n",
    "- **Data Bus** â€“ Carries data (bi-directional).\n",
    "- **Address Bus** â€“ Carries address to memory (uni-directional).\n",
    "- **Control Bus** â€“ Carries control signals (read/write).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Instruction Cycle (Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle)\n",
    "1. **Fetch** â€“ Instruction is fetched from memory using PC.\n",
    "2. **Decode** â€“ Control Unit decodes the instruction.\n",
    "3. **Execute** â€“ ALU or other components perform the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. CPU Types\n",
    "- **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)** â€“ Many complex instructions; fewer instructions per program.\n",
    "- **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)** â€“ Fewer instructions; simpler; faster per instruction.\n",
    "- **Superscalar CPU** â€“ Executes more than one instruction per cycle.\n",
    "- **Multicore CPU** â€“ Multiple processing units on a single chip.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Control Unit Types\n",
    "- **Hardwired Control Unit**: Uses fixed logic circuits; faster but inflexible.\n",
    "- **Microprogrammed Control Unit**: Uses control memory; flexible and easier to modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Performance Factors\n",
    "- **Clock Speed** â€“ Number of cycles per second (Hz).\n",
    "- **Instruction Per Cycle (IPC)** â€“ Efficiency of execution.\n",
    "- **Pipelining** â€“ Improves performance by overlapping instruction stages.\n",
    "- **Cache Memory** â€“ Small high-speed memory to reduce access time to frequently used data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Pipelining\n",
    "- Technique for executing multiple instructions in overlapping stages:\n",
    "  - **Stages**: Fetch â†’ Decode â†’ Execute â†’ Memory â†’ Write Back\n",
    "- **Hazards**:\n",
    "  - **Data Hazard** â€“ Instruction depends on result of previous.\n",
    "  - **Control Hazard** â€“ Due to branching.\n",
    "  - **Structural Hazard** â€“ Hardware resources conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Modern Enhancements\n",
    "- **Out-of-Order Execution**\n",
    "- **Branch Prediction**\n",
    "- **Speculative Execution**\n",
    "- **Hyper-Threading (Simultaneous Multi-threading)**\n",
